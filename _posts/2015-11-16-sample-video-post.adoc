Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).

Not sure if this only effects Kramdown or if it's an issue with Markdown in general. But adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix add a space between the `<iframe>` tags and remove `allowfullscreen`. Example below:

[source,html]
----
<iframe width="940" height="529" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CQJByFp7H38?theme=light&amp;color=white" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>

To start a video post, make sure your post contains the following contents in your post's Front Matter YAML:

    ---
    layout: post
    type: video
    title: "Sample Video Title"
    description:
    headline:
    modified: YYYY-MM-DD
