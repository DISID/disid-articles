We’re proud to have participated as sponsor and speaker at Spring I/O 2016 Conference in Barcelona where we talked about what's new in SpringRoo 2.0.0 M2.

In this talk we are going to present a preview of Spring Roo 2.0, a rewrite of the code generating tool for the development of Java web applications based on current Spring technologies like Spring Boot, Spring Data, etc. A release with lots of cool looking features supporting Spring Boot and removing the older ActiveRecord-style support in favor of proper Spring Data repositories.


https://twitter.com/enrique_ruiz_[Enrique Ruiz], CINO at DISID and Spring Roo project lead and https://twitter.com/cordinyana[César Ordiñana], CTO at DISID presented the latest features of Spring Roo.


The slides of our "SpringRoo 2.0 Preview" talk at Spring I/O 2016 are available at http://www.slideshare.net/disid/spring-roo-20-preview-at-spring-io-2016[SlideShare].

Proud to be part of Spring I/O 2016 Conference!
