To start a photo post, make sure your post contains the following contents in your post's Front Matter YAML:

    ---
    layout: post
    type: photo
    title: "Sample Photo Post Title"
    description:
    headline:
    modified: YYYY-MM-DD

Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Images are responsive and are opened in a Magnific Popup lightbox if you link a larger image to the entry. Also if you link a larger image, the image thumbs uses CSS3 transitions to turn B&W and change back to color on mouse-hover. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

== Figures (for images or video)

=== Align image

----
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[Tiger,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[Tiger,200,200,float="left",align="center"]

image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[[Tiger,200,200,align="center"]
----

image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[Tiger,200,200,float="right",align="center"]

image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[Tiger,200,200,float="left",align="center"]

image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[[Tiger,200,200,align="center"]


=== One Up

----
[[img-id-anchor-link]]
.A description image for caption figure with http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/[link].
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[Sunset, 300, 200, align="center", link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]
----

[[img-id-anchor-link]]
.A description image for caption figure with http://discuss.asciidoctor.org/[link].
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[Sunset, 300, 200, align="center", link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]


=== Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

----
[.half]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.half]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.half]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.half]
.Caption describing these three images.
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]
----

And you'll get something that looks like this:

[.half]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.half]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.half]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.half]
.Caption describing these four images.
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]


=== Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

----
[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
.Caption describing these three images.
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]
----

And you'll get something that looks like this:

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[A,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]

[.third]
.Caption describing these three images.
image::{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg[B,link="{{ site.url }}/images/cover-demo.jpg"]
